      <h2>Beware the Garbage Man's Scope</h2>
<p>Garbage collection can be an amazing resource to the developer, except when you forget its there as I did in a recent project.  I&#8217;ll be honest I started cutting my teeth on x86 assembler and C++. The mantra of the day was, don&#8217;t assume anything and clean up after yourself. Unless you&#8217;re trying to piss off the neighbours, which is never of any real benefit.  The simplified example of what happened is a variable initialization like so;<br />
\n@new Tween( pages, &#8220;rotation&#8221;, Elastic.easeOut, src, dest, duration, true );@</p>
<p>You can only guess how dirty I felt typing it, looking at it, breathing it in and digesting it.  It was wrong and I knew it. Its only reason for existence was laziness coupled with a 3am sugar buzz.  I figured, &#8220;Why create a member variable? I don&#8217;t care what happens to it after its done its deed.&#8221;</p>
<p>Unfortunately I didn&#8217;t realize how wrong it was until seemingly at random its expected effect would get tossed like <a href="http://www.foxmovies.com/fightclub/">Marla&#8217;s bridesmaid dress</a>.  Intensely loved for a moment, and unwittingly thrown to the curbside the second the garbage collector came along. I did a whole lot of <em>unnecessary</em> dancing around to debug why something so foolish wasn&#8217;t working 20% of the time. It was random, I wanted to pull out my hair.  I think there were brief moments where I actually did.  I finally gave it a big b-tch slap and applied some brute force using a &#8220;watchdog&#8221; timer that snapped it into the destination angle.  The timer was jarring to the user, it was a defeat for me, but it ensured the content was accessible instead of periodically ending in a rotation somewhere between here and Timbuktu.</p>
<p>I published the site only to shortly after find my salvation in the comments on Adobe&#8217;s Flash 9 Livedocs.  I cursed myself immensely at its simplicity, and my foolishness.  The simple fact of the matter is I didn&#8217;t take into account scope. I applied C++ assumptions of variable life time, whilst at the same time discarding the method for proper clean-up, a reference to the original object.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>In the future kids don&#8217;t play with matches, and if you want an object to last beyond a methods or functions scope make sure it is referenced outside of that method.</p>
<pre>
private var _rotation_tween:Tween;
public function rotatePage( dest ):void {
 _rotation_tween = new Tween( pages, "rotation", Elastic.easeOut, src, dest, duration, true );
}
